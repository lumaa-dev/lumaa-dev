I have a website in ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English with various informations: [lumaa.fr](https://lumaa.fr/)

## Who am I?
I am Lumaa, just a young independent French developer making random things. I also do [YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/@lumaa_dev) and [Twitch streams](https://twitch.tv/lumaa_dev) both in French, *for fun*. But I also have a YouTube channel made for [professinal stuff](https://youtube.com/@Lumaa_PRO).

## Coding Journey

### Premise
It all starts a few years back, trying to make a Unity game (C#) but miserably failed **multiple times**.  
Then in April 2021, began [Keymey](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/Keymey) as my **first JavaScript project** and **Discord bot**. I worked on it for a very long time, then did multiple other bots, like [Guildable](https://top.gg/bot/870762638789988422), Bongy and a few others.

Then around mid-2021, I started web development. As my first web project, I tried recreating Discord as much as I could and called it **Poorcored** (because it's a poor version). I did web dev without actually having a website. I, then, made [my own website](https://lumaa.fr/?lang=en) back in July 2022.

Also in that same period of time, in July 2022. I created [The Backrooms Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms), a Fabric Minecraft mod that adds the world of the Backrooms in Minecraft. A few months later, I published it on [GitHub](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/BackroomsMod) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms), and specifically on Modrinth, it blew. The mod's stats are sky-rocketing on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms)!  
After all of this, I made a library mod [LibuLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/libu) which is now discontinued.

### 2023
Then around February 2023, I discovered the world of [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org). It's complex but I'm still a beginner to this.

Through February to April, there were updates of [The Backrooms Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms) and [LibuLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/libu). During April 2023, a few new projects appeared on my [Modrinth Profile](https://modrinth.com/user/Lumaa) which are:
- [Act](https://modrinth.com/mod/acts) - Mod to fight loneliness, powered by **Actor AI**
- [Muppet](https://modrinth.com/mod/muppet) - Mod that adds the player's doll at the top left corner

During the month of May 2023, I posted a devlog on my [Support Discord](https://lumaa.fr/support) where I asked my members if they volunteered to help me code mods, [Tanish](https://github.com/tanishisherewithhh) DMed me and volunteered to help me, we then created [V-Fast](https://lumaa.fr/v-fast).\
He worked on [Act](https://modrinth.com/mod/acts) the most, including the entire rewriting of **Actor AI**.

And for most of the summer holiday (July-August 2023) I learnt how to do APIs and SQL manipulations using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com). Which I now have an API over on [api.lumaa.fr](https://api.lumaa.fr).

There hasn't been any big coding projects through September 2023, so nothing interesting.\
But in October 2023, I released my very first iOS App: [TicTac](https://apps.lumaa.fr/app/tictac). The app is currently available EVERYWHERE, in French and English. Here is a quick [showcase video](https://youtu.be/eDbPkcXqInE):

[![TicTac](https://img.youtube.com/vi/eDbPkcXqInE/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/eDbPkcXqInE)

November 2023, I listened to music... A ton... Which resulted in the creation in [ByHeart](https://apps.lumaa.fr/app/byheart). An app all about music and its knowledge.

### 2024
Kept this project under my wing, and to create a Mastodon client... which I announced a little before New Year's, called [#Threaded](https://apps.lumaa.fr/app/threaded) (The hashtag is not included). It uses code from [IceCubesApp](https://github.com/Dimillian/IceCubesApp) made by [@Dimillian](https://github.com/Dimillian).

In March 2024, I create my [read.cv](https://read.cv/lumaa), with a lot of details about my past projects and current.

The following month, I published [NumMemory](https://apps.lumaa.fr/app/nummemory) on the App Store. It's an app about remembering any number you choose, it could be a credit card number, a pin code, a phone number... Anything!

In May 2024, I launched my [newsletter](https://lumaa.substack.com/) powered by Substack. This allowed me to [announce](https://lumaa.substack.com/p/new-project-artisticly) in depth my new project: [Artisticly](https://apps.lumaa.fr/app/artisticly), which is a music client powered by [its own server](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/ArtisticlyServer). I'm also currently working on a *Super Secret Projectâ„¢* with a team of developers...

**And here we are today.**
