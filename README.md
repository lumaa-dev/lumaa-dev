I have a website, it's both in ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English and ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French for now: [lumaa.fr](https://lumaa.fr/)

## Who am I?
I am Lumaa, just a young independent French developer making random things. I also do [YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/@lumaa_dev) and [Twitch streams](https://twitch.tv/lumaa_dev) both in French.

## How did I learn all that?
It all starts a few years back, trying to make a Unity game (C#) but miserably failed **multiple times**.  
Then in April 2021, began [Keymey](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/Keymey) as my **first JavaScript project** and **Discord bot**. I worked on it for a very long time, then did multiple other bots, like [Guildable](https://top.gg/bot/870762638789988422), Bongy and a few others.

Then around mid-2021, I started web development. As my first web project, I tried recreating Discord as much as I could and called it **Poorcored** (because it's a poor version). I did web dev without actually having a website. I, then, made [my own website](https://lumaa.fr/) back in July 2022.

Also in that same period of time, in July 2022. I created [The Backrooms Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms), a Fabric Minecraft mod that adds the world of the Backrooms in Minecraft. A few months later, I published it on [GitHub](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/BackroomsMod) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms), and specifically on Modrinth, it blew. The mod's stats are sky-rocketing on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms)!  
After all of this, I made a library mod [LibuLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/libu).

Then around February 2023, I discovered the world of [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org). It's complex but I'm still a beginner to this.

Through February to April, there were updates of [The Backrooms Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms) and [LibuLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/libu). During April 2023, 3 new projects appeared on my [Modrinth Profile](https://modrinth.com/user/Lumaa) which are:
- [Act](https://modrinth.com/mod/acts) - Mod to fight loneliness, powered by **Actor AI**
- [Muppet](https://modrinth.com/mod/muppet) - Mod that adds the player's doll at the top left corner
- [Unknown SMP](https://modrinth.com/modpack/unknownsmp) - Official modpack of the [Unknown SMP](https://youtube.com/@unknownsmp)

During the month of May 2023, I posted a devlog on my [Support Discord](https://lumaa.fr/support) where I asked my members if they volunteered to help me code mods, [Tanish](https://github.com/tanishisherewithhh) DMed me and volunteered to help me, we then created [V-Fast](https://lumaa.fr/v-fast).\
He worked on [Act](https://modrinth.com/mod/acts) the most, including the entire rewriting of **Actor AI**.

**And here we are today.**
