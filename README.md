I have a website, but it's ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French for now: https://lumaa.brebond.com/

## Who am I?
I am Lumaa, just a young independent French developer making random things. I also do [YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/@lumaa_dev) and [Twitch streams](https://twitch.tv/lumaa_dev) both in French.

## How did I learn all that?
It all starts a few years back, trying to make a Unity game (C#) but miserably failed **multiple times**.  
Then in April 2021, began [Keymey](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/Keymey) as my **first JavaScript project** and **Discord bot**. I worked on it for a very long time, then did multiple other bots, like [Guildable](https://top.gg/bot/870762638789988422), Bongy and a few others.

Then around mid-2021, I started web development. As my first web project, I tried recreating Discord as much as I could and called it **Poorcored** (because it's a poor version). I did web dev without actually having a website. I, then, made [my own website](https://lumaa.brebond.com) back in July 2022.

Also in that same period of time, in July 2022. I created [The Backrooms Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms), a Fabric Minecraft mod that adds the world of the Backrooms in Minecraft. A few months later, I published it on [GitHub](https://github.com/u-lumaa/BackroomsMod) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms), and specifically on Modrinth, it blew. Not only we have a 6 months old project being continuously worked on, but we also have 500 downloads on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms)!  
After all of this, I made a library mod [LibuLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/libu).

**And here we are today.**
